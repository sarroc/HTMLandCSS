    <h3>Matcha</h3>
    <p>
      Matcha originated in China but the production of compressed tea, the raw
      material for matcha, was banned in China in the 14th century.[9] Shade
      growing was invented in Japan in the 16th century[10] and most matcha is
      produced there today.[11] The traditional Japanese tea ceremony, typically
      known as chanoyu (茶の湯) or sadō/chadō (茶道), centers on the
      preparation, serving and drinking of matcha as hot tea, and embodies a
      meditative and spiritual practice.

    <h3>In Japanese ceremony</h3>
    <p>
      Drinking koicha is considered as the main part of Japanese tea
      ceremony,[32] while drinking usucha is considered as a sub part of it.[33]
      In the ceremonies, matcha is stored and made using a special teaware
      called chaki. Specifically, matcha for koicha and usucha are stored in
      special containers, chaire (茶入) and natsume (棗), respectively. Prior to
      use, the matcha can be sifted through a sieve to reduce clumps.[34] Matcha
      is scooped out from these containers by chashaku (茶杓), a traditional
      Japanese spoon. Matcha and hot water are then put in a chawan (茶碗), the
      bowl, and stirred with chasen (茶筅), a whisk usually made from bamboo. It
      is drunk from the chawan. One drinks matcha after finishing (not during)
      eating sweets in order to allow a prolonged taste of the matcha.
