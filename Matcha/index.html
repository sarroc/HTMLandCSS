      Matcha originated in China but the production of compressed tea, the raw
      material for matcha, was banned in China in the 14th century.[9] Shade
      growing was invented in Japan in the 16th century[10] and most matcha is
      produced there today.[11] The traditional Japanese tea ceremony, typically
      known as chanoyu (茶の湯) or sadō/chadō (茶道), centers on the
      preparation, serving and drinking of matcha as hot tea, and embodies a
      meditative and spiritual practice.

    <h3>In Japanese ceremony</h3>
    <p>
      Drinking koicha is considered as the main part of Japanese tea
      ceremony,[32] while drinking usucha is considered as a sub part of it.[33]
      In the ceremonies, matcha is stored and made using a special teaware
      called chaki. Specifically, matcha for koicha and usucha are stored in
      special containers, chaire (茶入) and natsume (棗), respectively. Prior to
      use, the matcha can be sifted through a sieve to reduce clumps.[34] Matcha
      is scooped out from these containers by chashaku (茶杓), a traditional
      Japanese spoon. Matcha and hot water are then put in a chawan (茶碗), the
      bowl, and stirred with chasen (茶筅), a whisk usually made from bamboo. It
      is drunk from the chawan. One drinks matcha after finishing (not during)
      eating sweets in order to allow a prolonged taste of the matcha.

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>
      Start by macerating the strawberries. Use a fork to mix them with the
      sugar, lightly mashing them as you mix. Set them aside while you prepare
      the matcha.Next, prepare the matcha tea in two easy steps: Sift the matcha
      into a small bowl. High quality matcha likes to clump! The clumps are
      nothing to worry about—they’re totally normal especially with ceremonial
      grades. To break them up, it’s important to sift the matcha before mixing
      it with liquid. If you need, Matcha.com has a range of matcha tools –
      sifters, bamboo whisks, and more! Whisk the matcha with 1/4 cup water. Add
      the water to the bowl with the matcha and whisk vigorously from side to
      side—not in a circle. The lateral motion helps evenly disperse the tea in
      the water and create a foamy layer on top. A chasen, or bamboo matcha
      whisk, is traditionally used for this. To assemble the strawberry matcha
      latte, place the strawberries at the bottom of a large glass. Fill the
      glass halfway with ice, and then pour in enough milk to fill the glass
      two-thirds of the way full. Finally, pour the matcha tea on top. Stir with
      a straw and taste. If you’d like the strawberry matcha latte to be
      sweeter, add honey or maple syrup as desired. Enjoy!
